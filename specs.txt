Fair Schedule Single-Page Web App Specification
----------------------------------------------

1. OVERVIEW
   - Single HTML page displays schedule of events for a fair.
   - Public view (no phone numbers).
   - Admin view (phone numbers visible) triggered by URL flag (e.g., ?mode=admin).
   - Highlight the current day and the currently running programme.
   - Blur (visually de-emphasize) the programmes that have already finished.

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
   - HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap for layout/styling.
   - JavaScript + jQuery for data handling and dynamic rendering.
   - JSON for storing event data (converted from Excel).

3. DATA STRUCTURE (Example JSON Object)
   {
     "dayNumber": 1,
     "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "timeStart": "HH:MM",
     "timeEnd": "HH:MM",
     "programmeName": "...",
     "programmeDetail1": "...",
     "programmeDetail2": "...",
     "audienceType": "...",
     "participantName": "...",
     "participantPhone": "...",
     "coordinatorName": "...",
     "coordinatorPhone": "...",
     "volunteerName": "...",
     "volunteerPhone": "...",
     "guestName": "...",
     "guestPhone": "...",
     "snacksName": "...",
     "snacksPhone": "...",
     "snacksCount": 100
   }

4. UI LAYOUT
   - Header:
     - Title.
     - Optional search/filter bar.
   - Event List:
     - Displayed via Bootstrap cards or table rows.
     - Always show:
       * Date, time, programme name, audience type, etc.
     - For admin mode (?mode=admin in URL), show phone numbers as "tel:" links.
   - Highlighting/Blurring:
     - Check current date/time in JavaScript.
     - Compare each event’s date/time with the current date/time.
       * If the event is in progress (current time between timeStart and timeEnd), highlight it.
       * If the event’s end time is already passed, apply a blur or grayed-out style.
       * If the event is for a future day or time, display normally.
     - If it’s the current day, highlight the date header (or dayNumber) as well.
   - Footer:
     - Basic contact or disclaimers.

5. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
   1. Convert Excel to JSON.
   2. Create index.html with Bootstrap layout.
   3. On page load:
      - Load JSON using jQuery (e.g., $.ajax).
      - Determine current date/time in JavaScript.
      - Render each event:
        * Default style for upcoming or same-day-but-not-yet-started events.
        * Special highlight style for in-progress events.
        * Blur or gray-out style for finished events.
      - If ?mode=admin is in the URL, also render phone numbers.
   4. Optional: Add sorting, filtering, or search features.

6. ENHANCEMENTS (Optional)
   - Sorting by date/time or programme name.
   - Collapse/expand programme details for readability.
   - Quick filtering by day, coordinator, etc.
   - Display a “Now Live!” label for the currently running event.
