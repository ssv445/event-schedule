   - Public view (no phone numbers).
   - Highlight the current day and the currently running programme.
   - Blur (visually de-emphasize) the programmes that have already finished.

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
   - HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap for layout/styling.
   - JavaScript + jQuery for data handling and dynamic rendering.
   - Google Sheet for storing event data, available as CSV URL.

3. DATA STRUCTURE (Example data per row)
   {
     "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "timeStart": "HH:MM",
     "timeEnd": "HH:MM",
     "programType": "...",
     "programmeName": "...",

4. UI LAYOUT
   - Header:
     - Title.
     - Optional search/filter bar.
   - Event List:
     - Displayed via Bootstrap cards or table rows.
     - Always show:
       * Date, time, programme name, programme type, etc.
   - Highlighting/Blurring:
     - Check current date/time in JavaScript.
     - Compare each event’s date/time with the current date/time.
       * If the event is in progress (current time between timeStart and timeEnd), highlight it.
       * If the event’s end time is already passed, apply a blur or grayed-out style.
       * If the event is for a future day or time, display normally.
     - If it’s the current day, highlight the date header as well.
   - Footer:
     - Basic contact or disclaimers.

5. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
   1. Create index.html with Bootstrap layout.
   3. On page load:
      - Load CSN using jQuery (e.g., $.ajax).
      - Determine current date/time in JavaScript.
      - Render each event:
        * Default style for upcoming or same-day-but-not-yet-started events.
        * Special highlight style for in-progress events.
        * Blur or gray-out style for finished events.
   4. Add filtering on programType, Date and text search features.

6. ENHANCEMENTS
   - Sorting by date/time or programme name.
   - Collapse/expand programme details for readability.
   - Display a “Now Live!” label for the currently running event.
